# CDK Go Samples!

**NOTICE**: Go support is still in Developer Preview. This implies that APIs may
change while the AWS CDK Team addresses early feedback from the community. The team would love to hear
about your experience through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues).

## Useful commands

 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `go test`         run unit tests
